		<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
			<p>Hi, I'm Ashley. I've always been interested in photography and enjoy running around outside finding 
				strange things to photograph. From bugs to flowers and landscapes to animals, I photograph whatever
				jumps in front of my lens. Last year I decided to start classes to really learn how to take better 
				photos and to really learn how to use my camera. It's been interesting to say the least. I've definitely
				picked up on many new techniques and am constantly getting better. My favorite part was when I visited my
				family last fall and got the chance to practice with my little sister. The photos I took really showed 
				off how much I've learned.

		<h2 id="equipment">My Equipment</h2>
			<p>Here's What I use:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Cannon Rebel t5i</li>
				<li>Different lenses depending on the subject matter</li>
				<li>Adobe Photoshop (editing software)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Besides my main photography equipment, I have plenty of books and reference material that I look at before
			shooting. This helps me pick a concept or technique before I go out and practice.</p>
